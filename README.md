# FastResults
Inspired by [language-ext](https://github.com/louthy/language-ext) and [FluentResult](https://github.com/altmann/FluentResults), FastResults is a nimble .NET library for implementing the Result pattern, enhancing code readability and error management in your applications.

## Features
- ```Result<T> and Result```: Used to hold operation results, with the generic version representing results that carry values.
    
- ```Option<T>```: Declare variables that either have a value or are empty, eliminating nulls and their associated issues.

## Installation
You can install [FastResults with NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FastResults/).
